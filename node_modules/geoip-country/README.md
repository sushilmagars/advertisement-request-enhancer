geoip-country [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/geoip-country.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/geoip-country)
==================

Stripped down version of [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip), supporting only country lookup in reference to [geoip-lite-country](https://github.com/arve0/node-geoip-country). It makes less memory usage.
If you are not necessary to support ipv6 country data, please use [geoip-lite-country](https://github.com/arve0/node-geoip-country) for less memory.
This repository include not only MaxMind ipv4 country data, but also ipv6 country data.

The original software of this repository is written by Philip Tellis <philip@bluesmoon.info>, and latest version is available at [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip).
This product includes GeoIP datas which are created by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/).

Synopsis
--------

```javascript
var geoip = require('geoip-country');

var ip = "207.97.227.239";
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);

console.log(geo);
{ range: [ 3479299040, 3479299071 ],
  country: 'US'}
```


Installation
------------
### 1. Install the library

    $ npm install geoip-country

### 2. Update MaxMind's geoip data

    $ npm run-script updatedb


API
---

geoip-lite is completely synchronous.  There are no callbacks involved.  All blocking file IO is done at startup time, so all runtime
calls are executed in-memory and are fast.  Startup may take up to 200ms while it reads into memory and indexes data files.

### Looking up an IP address ###

If you have an IP address in dotted quad notation, IPv6 colon notation, or a 32 bit unsigned integer (treated
as an IPv4 address), pass it to the `lookup` method.  Note that you should remove any `[` and `]` around an
IPv6 address before passing it to this method.

```javascript
var geo = geoip.lookup(ip);
```

If the IP address was found, the `lookup` method returns an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
   range: [ <low bound of IP block>, <high bound of IP block> ],
   country: 'XX' // 2 letter ISO-3166-1 country code
}
```

The actual values for the `range` array depend on whether the IP is IPv4 or IPv6 and should be
considered internal to `geoip-lite`.  To get a human readable format, pass them to `geoip.pretty()`

If the IP address was not found, the `lookup` returns `null`

### Pretty printing an IP address ###

If you have a 32 bit unsigned integer, or a number returned as part of the `range` array from the `lookup` method,
the `pretty` method can be used to turn it into a human readable string.

```javascript
    console.log("The IP is %s", geoip.pretty(ip));
```

This method returns a string if the input was in a format that `geoip-lite` can recognise, else it returns the
input itself.


Built-in Updater
----------------

This package contains an update script that can pull the files from MaxMind and handle the conversion from CSV.
A npm script alias has been setup to make this process easy. Please keep in mind this requires internet and MaxMind
rate limits that amount of downloads on their servers.

```shell
npm run-script updatedb
```

Caveats
-------

This package includes the GeoLite database from MaxMind.  This database is not the most accurate database available,
however it is the best available for free.  You can use the commercial GeoIP database from MaxMind with better
accuracy by buying a license from MaxMind, and then using the conversion utility to convert it to a format that
geoip-lite understands.  You will need to use the `.csv` files from MaxMind for conversion.
